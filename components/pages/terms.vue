                  that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability
                  set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain

                  to provide the services to you on an economically reasonable

                  consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions
                  may not apply to you. In such cases, Easy IT Returns’s
